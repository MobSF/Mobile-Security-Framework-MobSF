Its mobile marketing solution combines user offline behavior understanding and algorithms to drive in-store sales. Its performance-based marketing solution delivers relevant, personalized ads that generate in-store sales it can measure. Co-founded in 2014 by Guillaume Charhon, Fran\u00e7ois Wyss and Benoit Grouchko, Teemo has 50 employees in Paris and New-York.\" [Teemo, 02](https://teemo.co/about)   \r\n\r\n\"Founded in 2014, Databerries offers brick and mortar retailers a mobile marketing solution, refferred to as Real Life Targeting, that targets mobile users based on locations they have visited in the past and measures the impact of marketing campaigns on store visits. The solution allows retailers to target users who have visited their stores and those of their competitors. The company\u2019s technology collects geolocation and navigation data from mobile users and targets them with relevant and personalised ads. This allows retailers to generate store visits with a significantly lower cost per physical visit (CPV). Databerries enables retailers to count the cost per visit and therefore measure the impact of a campaign on point-of-sale traffic, offering retailers a solution that works for offline marketing while combining online advertising standards such as accurate targeting, personalisation, performance measurement and return on investment optimisation.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Paris, Databerries employs 40 people and plans to double its workforce by the end of 2017. Since its launch, the solution has generated more than one million in-store visits and supports more than 20 prestigious advertisers on a daily basis. It serves more than 100 brick and mortar retailers including Carrefour, Decathlon, FNAC, Leclerc, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3).\r\n\r\nAccording to the company, offline retailers spend more than $100bn (\u20ac93.9bn) on advertising every year, relying largely on outdoor and other offline channels to increase store visits with limited ability to track the performance of their advertising campaigns. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the cross-platform and mobile advertising market is estimated to grow from $25.2bn (\u20ac23.7bn) in 2015 to $80.5bn (\u20ac75.6bn) by 2020, at a CAGR of 26.1%.\" [Go4Venture, 01](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_ \r\n* \"Real-life Targeting, Offline Measurement\" \r\n* \"Reinventing offline marketing\"\r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Android (Google Android ID) and Apple (IDFA)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databerries](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databerries)\r\n* _Teemo, 01._ [http://teemo.co](http://teemo.co)  \r\n* _Teemo, 02._ [https://teemo.co/about](https://teemo.co/about) \r\n* _Teemo, 03._ [https://teemo.co/sdkguidelines](https://teemo.co/sdkguidelines)   \r\n* _Teemo, 04._ [https://teemo.co/privacy](https://teemo.co/privacy)\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n* _Go4Venture, 01:_ [http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)  \r\n* _L'Expansion, 01:_ [https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/high-tech/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html](https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/high-tech/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html)", "id": 1, "code_signature": "com.databerries.|com.geolocstation.", "website": "https://www.teemo.co", "name": "Teemo", "network_signature": "databerries\\.com", "creation_date": "2017-09-24"}, "2": {"description": "## Primary Location\r\nFrance (Paris) [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fidzup)\r\n\r\n## Website\r\n[https://www.fidzup.com/en](https://www.fidzup.com/en)\r\n\r\n## About\r\nFidzup merges online and offline mobile marketing for retailers.

Continuous innovation and improvement help us to develop more and more relevant and quicker and quicker solutions to install for our customers\" [Fidzup, 02](https://www.fidzup.com/en/team). Their ambition is to \"Provide physical commerce with the tools that pure players now enjoy\". Where on the web professionals are able to identify a highly qualified target to better send them promotions, no solution existed for retailers to recover these prospects.\r\n\r\nSince its creation in 2011, Fidzup was working on an indoor presence detection technology. The idea was to offer retailers and shopping centers a light technology to deploy and without constraint of use for consumers. This is how Fidzup Microtargeting was created, a platform for sending interactive and location-based content on the mobile of visitors to points of sale. It is the explosion of Criteo, the French giant of online advertising retargeting, which pushed the Fidzup teams to pivot towards a similar solution, but to the brick & mortar business. Since the startup was already able to understand the behavior of consumers in points of sale.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, where Criteo is interested in the behavior of Internet users on e-commerce sites to retarget advertising on partner media pages, Fidzup is interested in the consumer shopper journey in physical stores to address contextualized advertising. on its mobile apps\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).  \r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Mobile (Android, Apple) / Fidbox\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_ \r\n\r\n* \"Online Offline: Performance mobile marketing for retailers\" [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en)\r\n* \"An innovative technology for interior presence detection\" \r\n* \"A mailing platform for geolocalized interactive content\" [Fidzup v2, 01](http://archive.is/kUZGK)  \r\n\r\n### Methods\r\nFidzup \"has developed 3 solutions to detect the presence of a consumer in stores: Fidzup Microtargeting, Fidzup Retargeting and Fidzup Analytics.

Thus, Fidzup captures and reactivates the consumer or simple visitor, either directly at the point of sale, or when he leaves the sign\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\nBig Data / Predictive analytics / Programmatic / RTB  \r\n\r\n_Consumer targeting:_ Geographical/store / Digital navigation (on devices) / Habits / Purchase intention  \r\n\r\n\"The most accurate in-store tracking technology on the market.

Fidboxes \"capture an encrypted identification key, unique to mobile, that Fidzup Retargeting then found on the ad servers. These captured data will be processed to segment the audience of the target brand to address on AdExchanges. This process will thus make it possible to resort to an advertising retargeting by displaying a personalized banner, according to the offline consumption habits of the mobile user, when he / she consults a third-party application (games, news, sports, etc.).\" Fidzup's \"point-of-sale deployment is lightweight and does not require any particular mobile application.\"    \r\n\r\n_Fidzup Retargeting:_ Fidzup's \"Totally innovative process allows the Terrasses du Port not to lose its consumers, increase its customer knowledge and optimize its media buying campaigns by addressing a qualified target. Fidzup Retargeting can also measure the visits of the consumer and know the generated downloads in a logic of measurement of the ROI of the carried out campaigns.\"  \r\n\r\n_Fidzup Microtargeting:_ Fidzup's microtargeting is \"based on the principle of indoor geofencing and allows shopping centers & retailers to interact instantly with their customers via their smartphone at their points of sale.\" It \"relies on the use of a sound source to send data to a smartphone that will decode and process the received signal. More concretely, Fidzup broadcasts via point of sale via any audio source (speaker system broadcasting music, sound boxes, televisions, etc.) a signal inaudible to the human ear. This signal has the particularity of having a unique identifier corresponding to a specific location. The detection is done when the smartphone receives the signal and decodes it to know where the consumer is.\r\n\r\nFidzup Microtargeting then automatically triggers the sending of interactive and contextualized content on the mobile of the consumer according to his position. Discount coupons, targeted promotion on a product upon entry into the corresponding department, exceptional opening information, contests triggered as soon as they enter the store ... For example, a brand wishes to launch a promotion on its polos: \"1 polo bought, the 2nd to -50% \u00bbFor this, she will have the choice between sending the promotion on the mobile of the consumer as soon as it enters the store or the entrance of the department concerned by the promotion.\r\n\r\nThe consumer then receives relevant content, at the right place and at the best time on his smartphone. With Fidzup technology, the sales area is 'squared': either at the entrance of the store itself or within a specific radius, it is possible for each manager to choose the right place, where the visitor will receive interactive content.  \r\n\r\n...Unlike other solutions that require the deployment of a heavy hardware device, and therefore expensive to install and maintain, the technology developed by Fidzup can be deployed without any hardware installation on site if the audio system used is remotely controllable. Indeed, some companies have specialized in the implementation of audio systems, the distribution of music in point of sale can be controlled online. These players cover a majority of the retail and retail market. If, however, the customer is not equipped, Fidzup has developed a battery of inexpensive hardware solutions that are easy to install.\r\n\r\n- Mobile Compatibility: The software brick developed by Fidzup (the SDK) integrates with applications running on iOS mobile OS (iPhone) and Android. Thus, thanks to Fidzup technology it is possible to reach more than 90% of the global mobile market.\r\n\r\n- Use: In the face of the few players capable of detecting presence at the point of sale, Fidzup chose to specialize in consumer care once it is present. Thus, the startup has developed the lightest solution to send promotional content at the best time to maximize efficiency. The end customer has no action to do (except to download the application of the sign or the mall), it is the content that comes to him automatically and at a time when he will be attentive. Since the media is mobile, it is essential to offer end users a limited number of actions to perform for a simple and fluid use.\"   \r\n\r\nThis can result in real-time data mining: \"Since the operations implemented are mainly digital, La Vache Noire has the possibility to follow in real time the impact of its operation (participation rate, winning prizes, etc.).\"  This can bring businesses that did not previously data mine into the data mining fold: \"Finally, the marketing department of the center has retained a certain interest from brands that have never participated so much in a digital transaction. Thus, prestigious brands such as Celio, Jules, Yves Rocher or Darjeeling participate each week in the operation 'List of promotions'\"  [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\n\"Fidzup has developed a means of communication between a sonic emitter and a mobile phone. Thus, by diffusing a tone, inaubible to the human ear, inside a building we can detect the presence of mobile phones and therefore their owners. How does the detection work? Your visitors must have the mobile application already installed on their smartphone. This contains a software layer (a SDK supplied by Fidzup) capable of detecting the signals and decoding them. What kind of sonic emitter can be used? It is possible to use any audio source to diffuse the signals. In fact, Fidzup has come up with a variety of hardware solutions depending on the user\u2019s requirements.  \r\n\r\n... We supply you with one or several bespoke sonic signals to diffuse in your establishment. Depending on the type of building and the type of usage you require, Fidzup offers a choice of several hardware and software solutions to simplify and optimize the diffusion of its sonic technology. Depending on the method of emission chosen, a sonic signal can be used to cover a precise zone of a store, the corridors of a shopping mall or even detect a visitor admiring a work of art in an art exhibition.\"   \r\n\r\n... \"Installing the SDK into your mobile application: We supply you with a software layer (SDK) to add to your mobile application. this layer detects and decodes the audio signal. The SDK is supplied with full documentation to help you install it swiftly and easily into your mobile application.The SDK is compatible with both iOS (iPhone) and Android operating systems.  Minimum requirement for the iOS operating system: iOS version 5; Minimum requirement for the Android operating system: Android 2.3.5 (HTC One X not supported)\" [Fidzup v2, 02](https://web.archive.org/web/20171015025307/http://v2.fidzup.com/en//notre-solution).\r\n\r\n_Fidzup Analytics:_ \"Fidzup Analytics is a technology based on wifi that analyzes the traffic in points of sale, especially for shopping centers and supermarkets. Coupled with the Fidzup Retargeting solution, this technology makes it possible to capture on average 40% of the real traffic, whether the consumers / visitors are carriers of the application of the center or not.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the handling of its solution, Fidzup gives direct access to the Analytics interface to the shopping center teams. The management can then see the route taken by its visitors from one store to another and analyze the data retrieved by day, week or month. Thus, Fidzup Analytics is able to display the traffic generated in the point of sale, the average duration of a visit, its frequency and to couple all these data to highlight trends or peaks of affluence. For the management of the center, the interest of these crossings of data is of size: to be able to identify the typical course of a customer and thus to define the zones \"cold\" or \"hot\" of the shopping mall (that is to say to say the locations more or less visited). Thanks to Fidzup Analytics, retail professionals can have a perfect knowledge of their customers, their habits in the center, but also know if their rental spaces are properly valued according to the passage of visitors. Finally, with the Analytics solution, shopping centers now have the opportunity to measure the audience generated by their communication devices already in place (promotional video screen, POS, display, totem ...). Indeed, depending on the information provided on these media, Fidzup is able to know the impact on the shopping journey of the customer and sales\"   [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\n\"Fidzup\u2019s Programmatic & Analytics Platform is made up of DSP, DMP and Tag management solutions, developed in-house for bricks-and-mortar stores. These technologies enable store managers to direct their campaigns while accurately measuring their return on investment\"  [BusinessWire, 01](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161130005981/en/Fidzup-Performance-Marketing-Startup-Retailers-Raises-3.7).\r\n\r\nSonice emission solutions:   \r\n\r\n- Web player: The web player allows you to emit the Fidzup sonic signal via your computer. This solution is ideal for small spaces with no audio system in place.  \r\n- Standalone emitter unit: This mains connected unit allows you to broadcast your sound signal continuously in the manner of a portable and independent speaker enclosure. This solution is ideal for creating an interactive zone in a specific area of your establishment.   \r\n- Mixer emitter unit: The mixer unit, also mains connected, can automatically mix your signal sound with the music played through your audio system. This solution is ideal for users wishing to cover all areas of their establishment through their own public address system.   \r\n- Custom installation: Your audio system is managed by an external provider? No problem, Fidzup can work with them to simplify the deployment, as it could then be managed remotely, without any hardware installation in situ\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).  \r\n\r\n_Web interface:_ \"We give you secure access to an administrative interface that allows you to devise promotional content that will be displayed on visitors\u2019 smartphones as soon as they are detected in your establishment.

Products and Services\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP offers a vast array of technologies in its data management platform. These are detailed in the Techology section under Details, below.\r\n\r\nServices provided by Salesforce DMP include:  \r\n\r\n* Accerlated Mobile Pages (facilitate mobile-optimized content)\r\n* Cross Device Identity Mangement (identify individuals across devices)\r\n* Salesforce DMP Einstein Segmentation (segment multiple personas in an audience)\r\n* Tracking (re-identify and track users using various methods)\r\n* Hashed device management (tracking used in reaction to Safari 3rd party blocking)\r\n* User matching (match users with various techniques to identify individuals)\r\n* Ad Server analytics (understand and analyze audience segment delivery and yield across all ad impressions)\r\n* Content engagement reports (loyalty report cards, site visits, and more)\r\n* Frequency engagement reports (how many times a user has seen an ad)\r\n* Funnels report (track customer behaviors across their customer journey)\r\n* Look-alike modeling (\r\n* Audience Profile Report (such as age, gender, and household income)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n**Opting out**   \r\n_DMP Opt-Out_ \"DMP Opt-Out\r\nhttps://apiservices.krxd.net/consumer/optout is the standard DMP opt-out URL. When called directly, this URL will execute the Opt-out action for a user and it will return the following JSON response:\r\n\r\n{\"code\":\"success\"}\r\n\r\nA user must allow cookies from Salesforce DMP in order to opt-out. Calling the DMP opt-out code (by clicking on an opt-out button placed on the client's page) will result in a persistent 'cookie' placed in the user\u2019s web browser by Salesforce, identifying that user as being on the Salesforce DMP 'do not target' list. Taking this opt-out step won't prevent all tracking and targeting online, but it will ensure the user\u2019s wishes are honored by all Salesforce DMP clients.\r\n\r\nNote: If the user uses more than one computer, the process must be repeated for each one as this information is associated with a cookie unique to each machine.\" [Salesforce, 7](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217039187-Privacy-Policy-and-Opt-Out-Guide)\r\n\r\n_On Mobile:_ \"Users can reset their IDFA or AdID to receive a new one. This is comparable to deleting cookies.\r\n\r\nThey can also block these completely by opting-out of Ad Track or Ads Personalization. In that case, Salesforce DMP cannot track or target these users.\" [Salesforce, 3](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428127-Mobile-IDs-FAQ)\r\n\r\n_In Safari FAQ:_ \"Is there any difference in the how 1st-party cookies and Hashed Device IDs treat opt-outs?\r\nYes, if the client is utilizing a first-party cookie and has multiple domains, a dedicated opt-out will need to be configured and maintained for each site. Alternatively, if hashed device management is employed a single opt-out link will be applicable for a given client.\r\n\r\nCan users opt-out of Hashed ID tracking?\r\nAbsolutely \u2013 unlike other providers of so-called Fingerprinting techniques, the Salesforce DMP actually can manage fingerprinting users through an opt-out. \r\n\r\nDoes Fingerprinting adhere to PII rules?\r\nYes, our hashed device management solution is fully compliant with PII protocols.\r\n\r\nDo both approaches lose uses when they clear their cookies?\r\nNo, first-party cookies can be cleared, while the hashed ID will persist even if cookies are emptied. [Salesforce, 4](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428307-Safari-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Can users opt-out of tracking in Mobile Apps?\r\nUsers can reset their IDFA or AdID to receive a new one.

However, they \"knew that first-party data (customers\u2019 email addresses and purchase histories) was where the puck was headed, so we doubled down on it.\"  They are driven by the concept \"people data\" because people, not browsers and mobile devices, are what buy things. [Salesforce, 1](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\r\n\r\n_Philosophy and approach:_ \"...when I am asked, what is the future of DMPs, I say that DMPs will become completely integrated into larger technology stacks offering a layer of data management (for both known and unknown data) for the \u201cright person.\u201d This orchestration layer consists of connected execution systems that seek to answer the \u201cright message, right time\u201d quandary. It also includes an artificial intelligence (AI) layer, which is the \u201cbrains\u201d of the operation trying determine how to stitch billions of individual data points together in real time.\"  \"...marketing is much more than ad campaigns. It is every experience a customer has with the brand, and we empower marketers to use data to impact every touchpoint along that journey, all powered by AI.\" [Salesforce, 1](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\r\n\r\n\"Some of the core reasons to use a DMP are to manage Identity and centralize user-level data for advertising and content personalization. Additionally, the DMP includes insights that help inform targeting and personalization use cases as well as campaign and personalization optimization.\" [Salesforce, 24](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012398067-What-if-I-just-want-to-import-data-instead-of-using-the-Control-Tag-SDK-or-other-DMP-tracking-)\r\n\r\n_Scope:_ \"Every month, Salesforce DMP interacts with more than 3 billion browsers and devices, supports more than 200 billion data collection events, processes more than 5 billion CRM records, and orchestrates more than 200 billion personalized consumer experiences.\" [Salesforce, 1](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\r\n\r\n\"The Salesforce Data Management Platform (DMP) allows publishers and marketers to collect and organize all of their consumer web data in one central \"big-data\" warehouse. Using Salesforce DMP, organizations can consolidate and reconcile their first-party \"web-behavior\" data that is generated by consumers as they engage with media and/or content with data from various third-party data providers like eXelate, DataLogix, Targus etc. Organizations can also integrate data from their user registration and subscription databases (hereon referred to as \u201cfirst-party data\u201d) into Salesforce DMP and join that data with web behavior and third-party data. \r\n\r\nUser data stored in Salesforce DMP is keyed off a global Krux User ID. The Krux User ID is a third-party cookie and as such is specific to a browser (and corresponding device too). All data that is collected by Salesforce DMP from online environments is automatically keyed off the Krux User ID.\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP supports the ingestion of first-party data available in client systems like registration or subscription databases and other CRM systems. This data is keyed off the client\u2019s first-party User ID. A User Matching process that maps the client first-party User ID to the corresponding Krux User ID for every applicable user facilitates the onboarding and ingestion of this data. \r\n\r\nAfter the user matching process has been setup clients can send first-party data corresponding to the matched users. Salesforce DMP has a strict data format for the first-party data outlined below.\" [Salesforce, 32](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918988-First-Party-Data-Import)\r\n\r\n_Billing Clients:_ Clients are charged for impressions, and a maximum amount for a single impression is calculate: [Salesforce, 34](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719688-How-Data-Costs-are-Billed)\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\n**AMP for Mobile Tracking**  \r\nAMP stands for \u2018Accelerated Mobile Pages\u2019 and is designed to facilitate mobile-optimized content. A notable aspect of the design is that it keeps 3rd party JavaScript out as much as possible to improve performance, however, there are AMP libraries available to provide additional rich content.\"  \r\n\r\nSee AMP FAQ for more: [Salesforce, 56](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428507-AMP-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Cross Device Identity Mangement (Declarative and Predictive)**  \r\nPredictive DCIM costs an extra fee.  \"The Predictive CDIM report describes all of the devices associated with people already in a given segment.  It allows you to identify and map consumers and behavior patterns consistently across all devices, screens, and platforms.\"\r\n\r\n_Key features include_: \"Connects known and unknown devices (declared and predictive) / Create a CDIM segment directly from the report / Aggregate audiences and their data across devices / A choice of similarity levels allows you to consider the trade off between accuracy and scale\".  _Key benefits include_: \"Improves reach, relevance, and inventory monetization / Increases your opportunity to sequence ads, at optimal frequency, for consistent messaging and experience across channels, throughout the journey / Delivers accurate analytics for segment profiles and campaign conversions?\r\n\r\n_Probablistic Matching:_  \r\n\"How does the probabilistic matching algorithm work?\r\n\r\nThe core of the model is designed to uncover the devices that stay together in various places over long periods of time. To do this effectively there are three important considerations - scale, training, and validation.\r\n\r\n* Scale - Because the success of the model is predicated on seeing lots of devices and how they move over time, it is essential to have massive reach into the device world. With one of the largest device footprints on the planet, Salesforce DMP has an advantageous position from which to deliver accurate results.\r\n* Training - Salesforce DMP uses deterministic data coming from authenticated events (logins, purchases, etc) to provide a truth set for training the algorithm.\r\n* Validation - From the deterministic data set, Salesforce DMP reserves some data to validate the efficacy of the model.\r\n\r\nBetween these three items we are able to continuously improve the accuracy of the predictions and deliver a better product.\r\n\r\nTo better understand the view of devices over time, consider a user's work and home movement. During the work day, all of the user's devices are likely to be tied to the same IP from work. However, colleagues are also tied to the same IP and in that single snapshot of time, it may be assumed the user and their colleagues are the same person.\r\n\r\nLooking at that same IP address at night, there is likely no activity, as everyone has left the office. When looking at the user's home IP at night, all of the devices that belong to that user and their family are tied to the same IP. That single snapshot might imply that the usr and their family are one \"person\".\r\n\r\n_Predicting with device composition:_ \"Device Composition: Salesforce DMP uses predictive cookie matching to fill in the gaps where cookies may not be present, such as mobile apps, Safari browser, ad blocking software, etc. However, because Google is looking for active audience cookies, the two systems use different logic around device composition. If your segment includes a high volume of non-stable cookies (mobile/Safari/cookie-less devices), that can impact the match rate.\" [Salesforce, 37](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010886887-DFP-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Each user creates multiple Krux User IDs (KUIDS) - cookies in browsers as well as IDFAs or AdIDs for mobile apps. Once our cross devices algorithm identifies that two of these KUIDs belong to the same person, we increase the count of \"people\" by one and select one of the KUIDs to be the \"leading\" KUID. We call this the one the \"Uber ID\". \r\n\r\nThere are some rules in place to determine which of the KUIDs is elected the Uber ID. This evaluation can change from day to day. If the Uber ID KUID is not active for a couple of days, it loses it's status as Uber ID. In this special case, the Uber ID is removed from the segment population list and shown accordingly as \"deleted\". \r\n\r\nIt is mainly Safari users to contribute to these Uber ID changes, as on Safari each page impression created a unique new KUID.\" [Salesforce, 54](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006652948-Segment-Processing-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Salesforce DMP Einstein**   \r\n\"Salesforce DMP Einstein Segmentation, which allows marketers to use machine learning to discover the multiple distinct personas that exist within their audience.\r\n\r\nUsing Einstein AI, on top of unified consumer data from both first and third-party sources, enables us to algorithmically determine the \u201cpersonas\u201d that best define a brand\u2019s audience. Now, companies can personalize marketing and reach each key persona with a message that is going to resonate, rather than blasting a one-size-fits-all retargeting message to everyone that happened to land on a particular webpage. For example, Conagra Brands has seen dramatic results by customizing the messages to different consumer personas for its Hunt\u2019s brand.\r\n\r\nThis is a great example of how our data management layer consisting of first, second, and third-party data can feed our growing AI layer to create tangible value for marketers\" [Salesforce, 1](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\"\r\n\r\n**Tracking**    \r\n_Device strategies & KUIDs:_ \"We differentiate between Mobile Web and Mobile App. Mobile work works just like Desktop Web with KUIDs stored as 3rd Party cookies.

Since it's not a 3rd party cookie \u2013 even though we are acting as an agent of our clients \u2013 it means that we are unable to sync those users with a 3rd party data provider unless the 3rd party fires a match pixel.\r\n [Salesforce, 4](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428307-Safari-FAQ)\r\n\r\n_CDIM & Hashing:_ \"What makes Salesforce's Hashed ID different from competitive offerings?\r\nThere are a few vendors outside of Salesforce who provide Hashed Device IDs, however, they do not couple it with a CDIM solution.

Match rate is the percentage of users of party A known by party B.  SF DMP match rates exclude Safari and app IDs.  Increased match rates create greater scale, and \"Greater audience scale creates more options for managing and optimizing campaign tactics such as segmentation, personalized messaging, frequency, omni channel journey, etc.\"  Because of 3rd party blocking, **Safari users can typicaly not be matched to partners at all.** \r\n\r\n\"By default, we run user match pixels on client\u2019s websites through the Control Tag for all partners a client is working with. We fire it on all pages with a frequency cap of 3 times over a 24-hour period for a given user. This will ensure return users are matched, but will not overwhelm client\u2019s sites with unnecessary tag fires. We set the tag to fire \"immediately\" to make sure users are matched before leaving the page. \r\n\r\nIt will take up to 30 days for the match rate to reach its peak after a new user match pixel has been activated.\r\n\r\nUnlike first party data that is exclusively available to the client who owns it, user match tables are shared across all Salesforce DMP clients. This way, each client can benefit from the user match pixels being fired on other client\u2019s websites.\r\n\r\nSalesforce has one of the largest footprints in the industry, thus providing exceptionally high match rates. Match rates can vary from country to country though, depending on both Salesforce's and the partner\u2019s footprint in that market.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible for partners to fire the Salesforce DMP user match pixel across all their inventory to improve the match rate upon request.\" [Salesforce, 23](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006072448-User-Matching-and-Match-Rates-FAQ)\r\n\r\nCritically, \"The Client User ID will have a one-to-many relationship with the Krux User ID in the User Match table. Note that in general, there may be multiple Krux User IDs mapped to a given Client User ID because the Krux User ID is browser specific whereas the Client User ID will be the same across multiple browsers (assuming that it is indeed a persistent user ID as opposed to a first-party cookie).\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, if there are 3 columns called Age Group, Gender, and Interest in the client\u2019s registration database that need to be imported into Salesforce DMP, then the following represents a valid data file that can be ingested by Salesforce DMP:\r\n\r\nUser1234^gender:male;age:18-24;interest:fishing\r\nUser2345^gender:female\r\nUser3456^age:35-44\r\nUser4567^gender:male;interest:fishing,boating\r\n\r\nWhen Salesforce DMP processes this file, we will create 3 attributes called Gender, Age, and Interest in the client\u2019s Salesforce DMP account. We will also automatically create the corresponding attribute values: male and female under gender and 18-24, 35-44 under age, and fishing and boating under interest.\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP supports full-refresh.\" [Salesforce, 32](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918988-First-Party-Data-Import)\r\n\r\nEvaluating matched users:\r\n\r\n\"Segment Population is the device population of this segment from the Manage Segments screen.

This includes Safari cookies, as per default Safari deleted all cookies after each page impression. A DSP Safari cookie will never show up again and thus can't be served ads to. Many DSPs also don't accept mobile identifiers (IDFA and AdID). So in those cases we also deduct them.\r\n\r\nSegment Match Rate is the percentage of users from the matchable population that we have matched the DSPs cookie against within the last 30 days.

They also store a record of the ads they serve in their logs. Log data includes \"your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\" They anonymize the log data by \"removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months)\". Google services, such as AdWords, AdSense, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services, may send cookies to your bro]]wser when you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these services.  \r\n\r\n_Other technologies:_ Google may \"select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.\"  \r\n\r\n_Location:_ Google may infer your location \"from a variety of sources\", including your IP address, search queries, as well as you \"precise location from your mobile device\" and \"websites or apps that you use may send information about your location\" to Google.  Google \"uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertiser.\"  \r\n\r\n_Mobile tracking:_ When cookies are not available (eg, in mobile devices), Google \"may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser.

Weborama recorded revenues of 24.3 million Euros in 2012 [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); revenues \"reached \u20ac29 million in 2016\" [Weborama, 05](https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures).

This is used for \"data solutions\" for advertisers; the Audience Manager gives \"an exclusive and native access to 400 million profiles in Europe\" with a \"360\u00b0 view of behavioural and socio-demographic data\".  Audience Insight \"allows viewing the audience structure by age, gender and occupation, along with the distribution of behavioural segments and clusters\", which \"helps publishers to drill down into their audience profile in real time, and thereby to maximise its monetisation\" [Weborama, 04](https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering).\r\n\r\nWeborama tags placed on a publisher's website allows them to \"collect raw and anonymous navigation data\".

Big Data is the driver of development today at Weborama, and will continue to be in the future. Great cares are taken to collect data anonymously, internet user benefits from more relevant advertising.\" [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation)\r\n\r\n_Semantic processing: Cookies, segmenting, & survey:_ \"the data is sourced anonymously from 300,000 sites, using cookies, then processed instantly. this audience classification is a critical process within each database. thanks to this methodology Weborama has a database of 110 million profiles of behavioural, socio-demographic, and purchasing intent data in Europe, 70 million of which are from France. Today, Weborama has identified almost 200 clusters (centres of interest) based on the behaviour of internet users, divided into 23 segments (a segment being a \u201cfamily\u201d of clusters). Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic database is built from a sample group of 300,000 active internet users in France who responded willingly to a questionnaire giving their age, gender and socio-professional category. by cross-referencing  behavioural clusters with Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic sample group, the sample group data are extrapolated from the database as a whole\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n_Patented technologies based on algorithms and the automatic processing of language:_ 33 million active URLs; 300,000 sites analysed each day; 110 million active profiles per month; 3.5 million qualified internet users per day; 25 words per day per internet user.\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n\r\n_Knowledge: 3rd party & 1st party data:_ The Weborama 3rd party database enriches 1st party data.  3rd party data is \"Data from a third party which do not belong to the advertiser or publisher, but are made available to them for deployment in online marketing\", whereas 1st party data is \"Data belonging to an advertiser or publisher.\"\r\n\r\n_Audience Segmentation & Targeted Advertising:_ With big data collections, Weborama can identify \"look-alikes\" of internet users with a similar profile to those who \"transform\" (\"subscriptions to products offered in the campaign\").  \"This allows them to be offered advertising which is personalised to fit their profile\".  Audience segmentation in media campaigns was introducted by an advertiser in 2012; the advertiser was looking to increase the level of transformation while reducing loss of media investments, and called upon Weborama to build a mechanism for its commercial catalogue.  Weborama creates a database, including from data collected by advertisers, and builds a targeted advertising model, which includes a model training phase and A/B testing.  \r\n\r\nData mining is conducted as follows: \"this database is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\"  Search and surf data is used; Weborama then views transactions over weeks, and observes outcomes from users in the database which includes 60 million qualified profiles over approximatley 300 columns, including ads viewed, reactions (visit, click), behavior on the website visited, and socio-demographic and behavioral profile.    \r\n\r\nTraining the model is conducted as follows: From the database, build graphic representation and create permanent tree segments. The criteria most relevant to each product or service can be extracted, where the criteria is based on transformation of the internet users exposed to ad campaigns and impressions.\r\n\r\nWeborama's database \"is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross-referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\" \r\n\r\nWeborama runs A/B testing to determine if the model is working, based on confidence intervals.  Variation can occur for many reasons, such as a calendar event or a holiday. \r\n\r\n_Segmentation for publishers:_ \"Above all, the aim of publishers is to organise their commercial products so that they can offer advertisers and agencies, in addition to the contextual menu, packs of targeted audiences, enriched by 3rd party data. the second challenge is to build specific audience packs using ad hoc target segments based on both socio-demographic and behavioural targeting (taking account of the internet users\u2019 different areas of interest).  \"Segmentation of a site\u2019s audience allows visitor profiles \r\nfrom other areas of interest to be seen. It is highly probable that a current affairs site has, among its audience, people who enjoy other sites (finance, beauty, fashion, cookery, travel...). this will offer the publishers the possibility of assessing their content quality, as well as that of their audience, while expanding their client base. \" \r\n\r\n_Two methods of data enrichment from publishers:_ The first method \"includes the synchronisation and propagation of Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic criteria and behavioural clusters on the publisher\u2019s site audience. this is possible by identifying profiles recognised within the site\u2019s audience, which are already part of the Weborama database. In this particular case, the adserver of the publisher calls the Weborama database for each internet user. If the Weborama database recognises the socio-demographic profile or behaviour of the visitor to the site, the visitor is transferred to the publisher\u2019s adserver. the publisher\u2019s adserver therefore now contains the socio-demographic and behavioural profile of the majority of its internet users.\"  \r\n\r\nThe second method \"identifies and analyses the website user\u2019s profiles to create ad hoc target users relevant to the advertisers\u2019 areas of activity.\"  Here Weborama creates _ad hoc_ profiles, and then there is a \"transfer of ad hoc target users\": \"the transfer of ad hoc users defined above is possible using a list of different adserver pixels. this transfer is done by a call of the pixels generated by the publisher\u2019s adserver. the volume of profiles per target required are then available directly in the adserver\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weborama](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weborama)\r\n* _Weborama, 01._ [https://www.weborama.com](https://www.weborama.com)\r\n* _Weborama, 02._ [https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation)  \r\n* _Weborama, 03._ [http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 04._ [https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering](https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering)  \r\n* _Weborama, 05._ [https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures](https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures)  \r\n* _Weborama, 06._ [https://www.weborama.com/documents/2017/09/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf](https://www.weborama.com/documents/2017/09/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 07._ [https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment](https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment)\r\n \r\n## External Links\r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, French):_ [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama)  \r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, English translation):_ [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama&prev=search](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama&prev=search)", "id": 6, "code_signature": "com.weborama.", "website": "https://www.weborama.com", "name": "Weborama", "network_signature": "weborama\\.net|weborama\\.fr", "creation_date": "2017-09-24"}, "7": {"description": "## Primary Location\r\nFrance\r\n\r\n## Website\r\n[http://smartadserver.com](http://smartadserver.com)\r\n\r\n## About\r\nSmart uses a \"full stack ad technology\" for digital campaigns [Smart, 03](http://smartadserver.com/request-a-demo).

Some news outlets have published details about Tinder analytical practices, often in conjunction with third parties. Minor press about Tinder and \"swiping right\" offers clues:\r\n\r\n\"Earlier this year, to combat this collection of overzealous swipers, the company set a limit on the number of right swipes users could make daily. Then it rounded up profiles of the most prolific right-swipers and watched what happened. Would they get upset and leave? Would they stop using for a while and lick their wounds? Or would they realize the error in their ways and be a little more discriminating in suggesting possible hookups?\" [Fortune, 01](http://fortune.com/2015/09/29/tinder-interana-analytics/)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nThe privacy policy for the Tinder Analytics SDK tracker is not public.

Features include location-based triggers, deep links, automatic actions, automated triggers, and scheduled campaigns [TUNE, 02](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/in-app-marketing).\r\n* _TUNE Marketing Console:_ \r\n* * Track user behavior on and offline, across devices, via TUNE's understanding of the \"customer journey\".\r\n* * Uniques identify users and target their \"proximity\" via location tracking.\r\n* * Help clients to \"Streamline your mobile marketing and measurement\" with services that are \"people-centric\". \r\n* * Unify data into one place, and give ownership of the data to the client. \r\n* * TUNE's APIs allows clients to sync with thousands of integrated partners [TUNE, 03](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/our-difference).\r\n* _Attribution Analytics:_ TUNE offers mobile analytics based on detailed performance reports and people-centric segmentation to maximize return on investment; analytics for re-engagement; analytics for return on ad spend; as well as analytics for fraud prevention [TUNE, 04](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/attribution-analytics).\r\n* _App Store Analytics:_ TUNE provides tools to optimize success in app stores [ TUNE, 05](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/app-store-analytics).\r\n* _Fraud prevention:_ TUNE Fraud services identify install and click fraud, allows businesses to set custom fraud rules, and provides analytics to detect and classify potential fraud [TUNE, 06](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/mobile-ad-fraud-detection-prevention)  \r\n\r\nTUNE is \"a 'data processor' that collects and analyzes End User data at the specific request of our client Advertisers, the 'data controllers'\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\nTUNE also tracks in-app user behavior and correlates it with a unique identifier [TUNE, 07](https://developers.tune.com/sdk/measuring-in-app-events).\r\n\r\nA simple version of TUNE's targeted advertising is provided on their opt-out website. It is explained as follows:  \r\n\r\n\"Within the TMC, two features allow advertisers to use data to target advertising to an end user:\r\n\r\n1. AUDIENCES allows Advertisers to build segments based on previously acquired attribution data (from the TMC's Attribution Analytics feature)...\r\n2. IN APP MARKETING allows advertisers to send end users push notifications outside of the app environment, as well as in-app messages - for promotional and other activities...\" [TUNE, 09](http://www.optoutmobile.com).\r\n\r\nIn this context, TMC covers \"Attribution Analytics, App Store Analytics, Audiences, and In-App Marketing\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nTUNE \"defines privacy as the end user\u2019s rights to receive notice, give consent, and opt-out of the collection, use, and sharing of data that is about or can identify that end user\".\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ TUNE has an opt-out website, www.optoutmobile.com, which details how end users can opt out of features in the TUNE Marketing Console (TMC) that target users online. Users can opt out of the \"audiences\" segment-based targeted advertising if they \"enable Limit Ad Tracking or \u201cLAT\u201d or re-set their ad identifier on their device OR opt out within the app itself\". They can opt out of \"in app marketing\" if they \"use the appropriate settings on their mobile platform (Android, iPhone, or Windows)\". Additional details of how to opt out of mobile on the outoutmobile.com website.  TUNE will pass on LAT requests to Advertisers, and will honor opt-outs provided to them by Advertisers. They also honor push notification opt outs set by the End User on their device.  \r\n\r\nOpting out of the TMC \"will not stop those users from receiving interest-based advertisements from Advertisers or other publishers or ad networks. End Users who want to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or Advertiser\u2019s ads must contact those companies directly to opt out.\"\r\n\r\n_Data ownership (TMC):_ \"Unless otherwise specified, and pursuant to the TUNE Data Pledge, Advertisers own the data that they provide to and collect through the TMC. When Advertisers remove or export their data from the TMC, their use of End User data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.\"    \r\n\r\n_Data collected (TMC):_ The TMC \"is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data, Email Addresses, and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution, app store optimization, and in-app marketing.\"  \r\n\r\n_Data sharing (TMC):_ Advertisers \"are able to view and measure data provided by TUNE, as well as third-party Partners that the Advertiser selects, in the TMC. For instance, an Advertiser can compare the results of advertising campaigns conducted with different Partners in the TMC. Advertisers and Partners may also send information to the TMC via Postback\"... Advertisers can share all data collected through the TMC with Partners via Postback, data exports, and/or API calls\". TUNE itself may provide or disclose, or enable others to provide, End User Data for the purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity of invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so.\"   \r\n\r\n_Personally identifiable information:_ \"The TMC does not primarily rely on data that is considered \u201cpersonal\u201d in other jurisdictions for Attribution and App Store Optimization. The TMC does support automatic hashing in cases where the Advertiser chooses to upload \u201cpersonal\u201d data into the TMC to ensure that the TMC does not process such data in raw form\". A detailed list of what TUNE considers PII and non-PII can be found at their data & security web page [TUNE, 13](https://help.tune.com/marketing-console/the-importance-of-securing-data-in-the-tmc).  \r\n\r\n_Advertiser data use permissions (TMC):_ Advertisers can use information collected through by the TMC for:\r\n\r\n* Attribution (eg, ad campaign analytics, cross-device attribution)\r\n* App Store Analytics (eg, A/B testing, analytics)\r\n* Audiences (eg, segments, behavioral and demographic profiling)\r\n* In-App Marketing (eg, push notifications, A/B testing of push notifications)\r\n\r\n_Regulation:_ TUNE complies with the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\n_International Law:_ TUNE adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.  \r\n\r\n_Security:_ TUNE \" uses commercially reasonable efforts including a variety of security technologies and procedures to secure client and End User Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n_Customers:_ ebay / Sony / Expedia / LINE / Supercell / Flipkart / Staples / Zillow / Sephora / Kabam / Starz / Draft Kings [TUNE, 01](https://www.tune.com) / MovieStarPlanet / Zoosk / Cheerz / SaferVPN / Schoold / Appromoters [TUNE, 12](https://www.tune.com/resources/resource-library/#customer-stories)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n_Financial details:_ TUNE was founded in 2009 and has raised over $36 million from funders [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tune).  \r\n\r\n_Innovation:_ TUNE claims to be at the forefront of many innovations in the advertising industry. They state they are \"the first self-service performance marketing platform, the original mobile app measurement product, and the first multi-touch attribution for app advertising.

Demdex offered a \"behavioral data bank\" for advertising purposes. The data bank was used for audience segmenting, and could be plugged into ad servers or services, giving websites and advertisers control over the data. DemDex was added to Adobe's \"Online Marketing Suite\" (powered by Adobe-acquired Omniture) [TechCrunch, 01](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/adobe-buys-behavioral-data-management-platform-demdex).  \r\n\r\n### Adobe Audience Manager\r\nAdobe Audience Manager is Adobe's data management platform, built on top of the Demdex product they acquired in 2011 [Analytics Demystified, 01](http://analyticsdemystified.com/adobe-analytics/adobes-new-marketing-cloud-visitor-id-how-does-it-work).

Products and services include:\r\n\r\n* _SafeGraph Movement Panel:_ SafeGraph's \"database of ultra-accurate GPS-location data that comes from anonymized mobile devices.\" The Movement panel offers:\r\n  * _Sink detection:_ Detection of inaccurate location data based on \" specific coordinates occurring at impossibly high rates\".\r\n  * _Teleporting detection:_ Detection of inaccurate location data when \"devices appear to move at impossibly fast speeds, ostensibly traveling large distances between data points that occur next to each other\" in data streams like bid streams.\r\n  * _Jumpiness detection:_ Detection of innacurate location data when \"we see two consecutive points in time that are fairly close but still implausibly spaced\" (eg, \"the GPS receiver in your phone lags or if a nearby skyscraper interferes with the location signal\") [SafeGraph, 01](https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475)\r\n* _SafeGraph Places API:_ This \"to easily find the places of interest that are near a given lat/long, ordered by distance or relevance\" [SafeGraph, 03](https://developers.safegraph.com/docs/places.html).\r\n* _OpenLocate:_ The OpenLocate SDK will \"collect location data (like GPS) from phones\" [SafeGraph, 04](https://github.com/OpenLocate). This includes an Android and iOS SDK.  The service is built to provide developers complete control over their location data.  Developers can build location-enabled features into their apps and \"maintain complete control over how end-user data is collected, where it is stored, and which APIs it will be sent to\". This includes sending to storage services (like Amazon S3) or APIs (such as Google Places API or SafeGraph's Places API) [SafeGraph, 05](https://blog.safegraph.com/introducing-openlocate-the-open-source-location-sdk-f5c5d2739a48).\r\n\r\nOther services include:\r\n* \"Detailed polygon maps on 50+ million U.S. places of interest\r\n* Understanding of each business's popularity, taxonomy, hours, etc.\r\n* Core investments in benchmarking via truth sets\"\r\n  * This includes Explicit Truth Sets (Check-ins, Daily diaries, Web surveys) and Implicit Truth Sets (Credit card data, Receipt data, First-party transactions) \r\n\r\nData from visits may include:\r\n\r\n* _Core truth set for matching:_\r\n  * High-res GPS data\r\n  * Deterministic data\r\n  * Explicit and implicit truth\r\n  * Data collected in background from large population\r\n* _Deep places map:_\r\n  * Best polygons\r\n  * Footprint geometries\r\n  * Metadata\r\n  * Categories\r\n  * Hours of operation\r\n* Machine learning technology\r\n  * Cross-validated against multiple independent 3rd party truth sets about where people go\r\n* _Truth and accuracy_\r\n  * High Precision // Low false positive rate; High recall // Low false negative rate\" [SafeGraph, 06](https://www.safegraph.com/truth)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n_Data collection (method and use):_ SafeGraph collects data from \"trusted third-party data partners such as mobile application developers, through APIs and other delivery methods\". The data collection and use is \"governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by SafeGraph.\" SafeGraph \"aggregates data collected from our data partners, and allows third party customers to access the Data for a variety of purposes such as ad targeting, traffic analysis, and market research.\" SafeGraph may also use data for their own \"internal and operational purposes\", and share data in response to requests from law enforcement or a governmental agency, \"to protect or enforce our rights or those of others, or to investigate potential wrongdoing.\"  Data can also be transferred to a successor entity in the event of a merger or acquisition.\r\n\r\n_Information collected:_ Information collected includes \"data regarding a device\u2019s precise geographic location, as well as other mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFAs and Google Android IDs, and other information about users and their devices.\"  \r\n\r\n_Jurisdictions:_ \"SafeGraph stores and processes information on servers in many countries around the world. We therefore may process your information on a server located outside the country where you live... Our customers (or companies that help us process the Data) may be located in other countries, so the Data we provide may be processed or used in a variety of countries, other than those our users reside in.\"  Customers of SafeGraph may create cross-device capabilities \"to enable marketers to target users across various channels and devices.\"\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ SafeGraph informs users of opt-out procedures for interest-based advertising and location tracking.  To opt out of interest-based advertising, they state, users can adjust settings in their Android or iOS devices.  This procedure, which they note may change, is mentioned in the SafeGraph privacy policy \"purely for informational purposes.\"  SafeGraph further notes that \"You also can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device. (Certain services may lose functionality as a result.)\"  SafeGraph's Privacy Policy provides links to the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, as well as www.youronlinechoices.com.  It informs users that these websites may provide additional opt-out options.\r\n\r\n_Retention:_ Information SafeGraph collects is \"retained indefinitely unless there has been a direct opt-out with us as directed above.\"\r\n\r\n_Security:_ SafeGraph has security policies and procedures to \" ensure compliance with industry best practices.\"  They state, \"no physical or technological safeguards are 100 percent secure, we do not guarantee the security of any particular elements of Data that we hold\" [SafeGraph, 07](https://www.safegraph.com/privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n##
