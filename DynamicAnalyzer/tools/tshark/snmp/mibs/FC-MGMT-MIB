            switch - a fabric element conforming to the Fibre Channel
            switch fabric set of standards (e.g., [FC-SW-3]).

            bridge - a device that encapsulates Fibre Channel frames
            within another protocol (e.g., [FC-BB], FC-BB-2).

            gateway - a device that converts an FC-4 to another protocol
            (e.g., FCP to iSCSI).

            host - a computer system that provides end users with
            services such as computation and storage access.

            storageSubsys - an integrated collection of storage
            controllers, storage devices, and necessary software that
            provides storage services to one or more hosts.

            storageAccessDev - a device that provides storage management
            and access for heterogeneous hosts and heterogeneous devices
            (e.g., medium changer).

            nas - a device that connects to a network and provides file
            access services.

            wdmux - a device that modulates/demodulates each of several
            data streams (e.g., Fibre Channel protocol data streams)
            onto/from a different part of the light spectrum in an
            optical fiber.
