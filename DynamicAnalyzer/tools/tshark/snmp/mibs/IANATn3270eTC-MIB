            "This module defines a set of textual conventions
            for use by the TN3270E-MIB and the TN3270E-RT-MIB.

            Any additions or changes to the contents of this
            MIB module must first be discussed on the tn3270e
            working group list at: tn3270e&list.nih.gov
            and approved by one of the following TN3270E
            working group contacts:

                Ed Bailey (co-chair) - elbailey&us.ibm.com
                Michael Boe (co-chair) - mboe&cisco.com
                Ken White - kennethw&vnet.ibm.com
                Robert Moore - remoore&us.ibm.com

            The above list of contacts can be altered with
            the approval of the two co-chairs.

            The Textual Conventions defined within this MIB have
            no security issues associated with them unless
            explicitly stated in their corresponding
            DESCRIPTION clause."

          This textual convention is similar to the TAddress

          RFC856
          transmitBinary  The sender of this command REQUESTS
                          permission to begin transmitting, or
                          confirms that it will now begin
                          transmitting characters which are to
                          be interpreted as 8 bits of binary
                          data by the receiver of the data.
          RFC860
          timingMark      The sender of this command REQUESTS
                          that the receiver of this command
                          return a WILL TIMING-MARK in the data
                          stream at the 'appropriate place'.
          RFC885
          endOfRecord     The sender of this command requests
                          permission to begin transmission of
                          the Telnet END-OF-RECORD (EOR) code
                          when transmitting data characters, or
                          the sender of this command confirms it
                          will now begin transmission of EORs
                          with transmitted data characters.

          terminalType    Sender is willing to send terminal
                          type information in a subsequent
                          sub-negotiation.

          tn3270Regime    Sender is willing to send list of
                          supported 3270 Regimes in a
                          subsequent sub-negotiation.
          RFC2355
          scsCtlCodes     (Printer sessions only).  Allows the
                          use of the SNA Character Stream (SCS)
                          and SCS control codes on the session.
                          SCS is used with LU type 1 SNA sessions.
          dataStreamCtl   (Printer sessions only).  Allows the use
                          of the standard 3270 data stream.  This
                          corresponds to LU type 3 SNA sessions.
          responses       Provides support for positive and
                          negative response handling.  Allows the
                          server to reflect to the client any and
                          all definite, exception, and no response
                          requests sent by the host application.
          bindImage       Allows the server to send the SNA Bind
                          image and Unbind notification to the
                          client.
          sysreq          Allows the client and server to emulate
                          some (or all, depending on the server) of
                          the functions of the SYSREQ key in an SNA
