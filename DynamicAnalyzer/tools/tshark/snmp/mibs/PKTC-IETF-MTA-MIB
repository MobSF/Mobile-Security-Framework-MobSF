          For example, if the value of the pktcMtaDevEnabled object

          object instance will contain the human-readable string of
          '1.3.6.1.2.1.140.1.1.6.0'.
          If the MTA generated an error because it was not able

          instance would contain an empty value (zero-length

          For example, if the value of an OID in the configuration

          the MTA was not able to recognize this OID as a valid one,

          Note that the syntax of this object is SnmpAdminString

--  that caps at the maximum timeout value
--  (pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout).
--  Retransmissions stop when the maximum retry counter is reached
--  (pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxRetries).
--  For example, with values of 3 seconds for the nominal

--  and with an exponential value of 2, this results in
--  retransmission intervals will be 3 s, 6 s, 12 s, 24 s, 48 s,

--=================================================================
--
--   Informative Procedures for Setting up Security Associations
--



--   A Security Association may be set up either via configuration or
--   via NCS signaling.
--
--   I.   Security association setup via configuration.
--
--   The realm must be configured first.  Associated with the realm
--   is a KDC.  The realm table (pktcMtaDevRealmTable) indicates
--   information about the realm (e.g., name, organization name) and
--   parameters associated with KDC communications (e.g., grace
--   periods, AS Request/AS Reply adaptive back-off parameters).
--
--   Once the realm is established, one or more CMS(es) may be
--   defined in the realm.  Associated with each CMS
--   entry in the pktcMtaDevCmsTable is an explicit reference
--   to a Realm via the realm name (pktcMtaDevCmsKerbRealmName),
--   the FQDN of the CMS, and parameters associated with IPSec
--   key management with the CMS (e.g., clock skew, AP Request/
--   AP Reply adaptive back-off parameters).
--
--   II.  Security association setup via NCS signaling.
--
--   The procedure of establishing the Security Associations
--   for NCS signaling is described in the PacketCable Security
--   specification.
--   It involves the analysis of the pktcNcsEndPntConfigTable row
--   for the corresponding endpoint number and the correlation of
--   the CMS FQDN from this row with the CMS Table and
--   consequently, with the Realm Table.  Both of these tables
--   are defined below.  The pktcNcsEndPntConfigTable is defined in
--   the IP over Cable Data Network (IPCDN)
--   NCS Signaling MIB [NCSSIGMIB].
--
--   III.  When the MTA receives wake-up or re-key messages from a
--   CMS, it performs key management based on the corresponding
--   entry in the CMS table.  If the matching CMS entry does not
--   exist, it must ignore the wake-up or re-key messages.
--
--=================================================================
--=================================================================
--
--   pktcMtaDevRealmTable
--
--   The pktcMtaDevRealmTable shows the KDC realms.  The table is
--   indexed with pktcMtaDevRealmIndex.  The Realm Table contains the
--   pktcMtaDevRealmName in conjunction with any server that needs
--   a Security Association with the MTA.  Uppercase must be used
--   to compare the pktcMtaDevRealmName content.

--  Unsolicited key updates are retransmitted according to an
--  exponential back-off mechanism using two timers and a maximum
--  retry counter for AS replies.
--  The initial retransmission timer value is the nominal timer
--  value (pktcMtaDevCmsUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout).  The
--  retransmissions occur with an exponentially increasing interval
--  that caps at the maximum timeout value
--  (pktcMtaDevCmsUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout).
--  Retransmissions stop when the maximum retry counter is reached
--  (pktcMatDevCmsUnsolicitedMaxRetries).
--  For example, with values of 3 seconds for the nominal
--  timer, 20 seconds for the maximum timeout, and 5 retries max,
--  retransmission intervals will be 3 s, 6 s, 12 s,



--  20 s, and 20 s; retransmissions then stop due to the

            devices are only required to support Organization
            Name values of up to 64 UTF-8 encoded characters.
            Given that RFCs 3280 and 4630 define the UTF-8 encoding,
            compliant devices must support a maximum size of 384
            octets for pktcMtaDevRealmOrgName.  The calculation of
            384 octets comes from the RFC 3629 UTF-8 encoding
            definition whereby the UTF-8 encoded characters
            are encoded as sequences of 1 to 6 octets,
            assuming that code points as high as 0x7ffffffff
            might be used.  Subsequent versions of Unicode and ISO
            10646 have limited the upper bound to 0x10ffff.



            Consequently, the current version of UTF-8, defined in
            RFC 3629, does not require more than four octets to
            encode a valid code point."

        OBJECT pktcMtaDevRealmOrgName
            SYNTAX LongUtf8String (SIZE (1..384))
            DESCRIPTION
                 "The Organization Name field in X.509 certificates
            can contain up to 64 UTF-8 encoded characters, as
            defined in RFCs 3280 and 4630.  Therefore, compliant
            devices are only required to support Organization
            Name values of up to 64 UTF-8 encoded characters.
            Given that RFCs 3280 and 4630 define the UTF-8 encoding,
            compliant devices must support a maximum size of 384
            octets for pktcMtaDevRealmOrgName.  The calculation of
            384 octets comes from the RFC 3629 UTF-8 encoding
            definition whereby the UTF-8 encoded characters
            are encoded as sequences of 1 to 6 octets,
            assuming that code points as high as 0x7ffffffff
            might be used.  Subsequent versions of Unicode and ISO
            10646 have limited the upper bound to 0x10ffff.
            Consequently, the current version of UTF-8, defined in
            RFC 3629 does not require more than four octets to
            encode a valid code point."
