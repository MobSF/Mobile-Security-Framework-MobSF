          -- is indexed by the MAC address of the host, through
          -- which a random access may be achieved.
 
          -- The hostTimeTable contains data in the same format as the
          -- hostTable, and must contain the same set of hosts, but is
          -- indexed using hostTimeCreationOrder rather than hostAddress.
          -- The hostTimeCreationOrder is an integer which reflects
          -- the relative order in which a particular entry was

          -- discovered and thus inserted into the table.  As this
          -- order, and thus index, is among those entries currently
          -- in the table, the index for a particular entry may change
          -- if an (earlier) entry is deleted.  Thus the association
          -- between hostTimeCreationOrder and hostTimeEntry may be
          -- broken at any time.
 
          -- The hostTimeTable has two important uses.  The first is the
          -- fast download of this potentially large table.  Because the
          -- index of this table runs from 1 to the size of the table,
          -- inclusive, its values are predictable.  This allows very
          -- efficient packing of variables into SNMP PDU's and allows
          -- a table transfer to have multiple packets outstanding.
          -- These benefits increase transfer rates tremendously.
 
          -- The second use of the hostTimeTable is the efficient
          -- discovery by the management station of new entries added
          -- to the table.  After the management station has
          -- downloaded the entire table, it knows that new entries
          -- will be added immediately after the end of the current
          -- table.  It can thus detect new entries there
          -- and retrieve them easily.
 
          -- Because the association between hostTimeCreationOrder and
          -- hostTimeEntry may be broken at any time, the management
          -- station must monitor the related hostControlLastDeleteTime
          -- object.  When the management station thus detects a deletion,
          -- it must assume that any such associations have been broken,
          -- and invalidate any it has stored locally.  This includes
          -- restarting any download of the hostTimeTable that may have
          -- been in progress, as well as rediscovering the end of the
          -- hostTimeTable so that it may detect new entries.  If the
          -- management station does not detect the broken association,
          -- it may continue to refer to a particular host by its
          -- creationOrder while unwittingly retrieving the data
          -- associated with another host entirely.  If this happens
          -- while downloading the host table, the management station
          -- may fail to download all of the entries in the table.

                  algorithm are those that have the corresponding
                  filterPktStatusMask bit equal to one.
 
                  The following two rules are then applied to every
                  packet:
 
                  (1) For each relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask
                      bit set to zero, if the bit from the packet
                      status is not equal to the corresponding bit
                      from the filterPktStatus, then the packet will
                      fail this status match.
 
                  (2) If for every relevant bit from the packet status
                      with the corresponding filterPktStatusNotMask
                      bit set to one, the bit from the packet status
                      is equal to the corresponding bit from the
                      filterPktStatus, then the packet will fail
                      this status match.
 
                  Any packets that have not failed either of the two
                  matches above have passed this status match.
 
                  The value of the packet status is a sum.  This sum
                  initially takes the value zero.  Then, for each
                  error, E, that has been discovered in this packet,
                  2 raised to a value representing E is added to the sum.
                  The errors and the bits that represent them are
                  dependent on the media type of the interface that
                  this channel is receiving packets from.
 
                  The errors defined for a packet captured off of an
                  Ethernet interface are as follows:
 
                      bit #    Error
                          0    Packet is longer than 1518 octets
                          1    Packet is shorter than 64 octets
                          2    Packet experienced a CRC or Alignment
                               error
 
                  For example, an Ethernet fragment would have a
                  value of 6 (2^1 + 2^2).
 
                  As this MIB is expanded to new media types, this
                  object will have other media-specific errors defined.
 
                  For the purposes of this status matching algorithm, if
                  the packet status is longer than this
                  object, filterPktStatus this object is conceptually
                  extended with '0' bits until it reaches the size of
                  the packet status.

                  If this channel is configured to generate events
                  when packets are matched, a means of controlling
                  the flow of those events is often needed.  When
                  this object is equal to eventReady(1), a single
                  event may be generated, after which this object
                  will be set by the probe to eventFired(2).  While
                  in the eventFired(2) state, no events will be
                  generated until the object is modified to
                  eventReady(1) (or eventAlwaysReady(3)).  The
                  management station can thus easily respond to a
                  notification of an event by re-enabling this object.
 
                  If the management station wishes to disable this
                  flow control and allow events to be generated
                  at will, this object may be set to
                  eventAlwaysReady(3).  Disabling the flow control
