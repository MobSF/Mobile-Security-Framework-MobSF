       DESCRIPTION
           "The MIB module registers object identifier values for
            well-known programming and scripting languages. Every
            language registration MUST describe the format used
            when transferring scripts written in this language.

            Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB
            module require Designated Expert Review as defined in
            the Guidelines for Writing IANA Considerations Section
            document. The Designated Expert will be selected by
            the IESG Area Director of the OPS Area.

            Note, this module does not have to register all possible
            languages since languages are identified by object
            identifier values. It is therefore possible to registered 
            languages in private OID trees. The references given below are not
            normative with regard to the language version. Other
            references might be better suited to describe some newer 
            versions of this language. The references are only
            provided as `a pointer into the right direction'."
