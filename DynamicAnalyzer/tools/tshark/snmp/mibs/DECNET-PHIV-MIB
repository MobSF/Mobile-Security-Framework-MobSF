PhivAddr ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (2))
-- This data type is intended as a short word representation of
-- standard DECnet Phase IV addresses. DECnet addresses are
-- hierarchically structured numbers assigned to a particular
-- DECnet node. The address is structured so that the area
-- number is contained in the most significant 6 bits of the

-- the first two bits of the host address.  The remainder of
-- the host address is contained in the second octet.

-- This data type has been created for DECnet counters.  These
