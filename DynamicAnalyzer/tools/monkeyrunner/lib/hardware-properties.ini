# This file describes the properties of a given virtual device configuration file.
#
# Note: Most top-level properties are boolean that control whether a feature is
#       present or not. Sub-features that depend on it are ignored if their
#       parent is set to 'false' or 'no'
#
# This file is parsed by 'android/tools/gen-hw-config.py' to generate
# 'android/avd/hw-config-defs.h'. The latter is a special header containing
# macro statements that is used several times:
#
#  - once to define the fields of the AndroidHwConfig structure
#    (see android/avd/hw-config.h)
#
#  - once to implement the hardware configuration loader
#    (see android/avd/hw-config.h)
#
# It is also packaged by the SDK and parsed by tools to let the developers
# create AVDs.
